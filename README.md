## Interactive ASCII Phone Application

This application was designed by Freja Smith for the video game [Unknown Number](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1692340/Unknown_Number_A_First_Person_Talker/), produced by [Godolphin Games](https://www.godolphingames.com/).

Unknown Number is a 'First Person Talker' which means the player must use their voice to interact with the game, answer calls and solve puzzles.

The interactive ASCII phone application simulates a phonecall by
- displaying the dialled numbers
- playing an audio recording when the correct number is dialled
- playing an error message when an incorrect number is dialled
- cancelling the call and clearing the screen when the cancel button is pressed

View the live site [here](https://adifferentphone.sligoil.com/). Use test number `101` for a successful call.

This application was created using create-react-app. It incorporates an ASCII animation designed by [Andreas Gysin](https://play.ertdfgcvb.xyz/) and ASCII art by Joan Stark.
